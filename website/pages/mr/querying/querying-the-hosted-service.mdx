title: Querying the Hosted Service
---

With the subgraph deployed, visit the [Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) to open up a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) interface where you can explore the deployed GraphQL API for the subgraph by issuing queries and viewing the schema.

खाली एक उदाहरण दिले आहे, परंतु कृपया सबग्राफच्या घटकांची चौकशी कशी करायची याच्या संपूर्ण संदर्भासाठी [Query API](/querying/graphql-api) पहा.

## Example

This query lists all the counters our mapping has created. Since we only create one, the result will only contain our one `default-counter`:

```graphql
{
  counters {
    id
    value
  }
}
```

## Using The Hosted Service

The Graph Explorer and its GraphQL playground is a useful way to explore and query deployed subgraphs on the Hosted Service.

Some of the main features are detailed below:
